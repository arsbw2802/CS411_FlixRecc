## Project Summary
A relational database will be constructed based on the public IMDb dataset. This database will be queried in order to supply a web-based application which returns film suggestions based on the user’s preferences of actors, genres, ratings, languages, and release date. The user will create an account, which will first ask for the user’s preferences on the genres, favorite actors, etc. Based on the user’s preferences we would provide the user with suggestions for more media to watch.
